# Creatiview

Creatiview aims to be a tool for artists to upload their work and share for review and comments by sharing a link. Reviewers can then follow that link, and leave their thoughts on specific parts of the piece by clicking their point of interest!

Stories can be found here on Trello: https://trello.com/b/XTegjaWo/creatiview
