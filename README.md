# Creatiview

Creatiview aims to be a tool for artists to upload their work and share for review and comments by sharing a link. Reviewers can then follow that link, and leave their thoughts on specific parts of the piece by clicking their point of interest!

Stories can be found here on Trello: https://trello.com/b/XTegjaWo/creatiview

## Setup

> Needs yarn and node

1. Clone/download repo. In terminal, move to your local copy's folder
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. Run `yarn start` to serve app on localhost

For a quick component overview, run Storybook
`yarn storybook`

Note: This project comes with recommended VS Code extensions that improve the development process. Give it a try if you like!

## Image Upload Preparations

> For now, images are self hosted only on Google at the moment!

To use this app, you'll have to have:

1. a Google drive account
2. a folder within drive that is set to public
3. the file id of the piece you'd like to upload.
